# ⚽ Prediction League Bot

A Discord bot for running a Premier League & World Cup prediction league. Users predict match scores and earn points based on accuracy.

## Scoring
| Prediction | Points |
|---|---|
| 🎯 Exact score | **3 pts** |
| ✅ Correct result (W/D/L) | **1 pt** |
| ❌ Wrong result | **0 pts** |

---

## Setup

### 1. Create your Discord bot

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** → give it a name
3. Go to **Bot** → click **Add Bot**
4. Copy the **Token** (you'll need this)
5. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Server Members Intent** (optional but useful)
6. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**:
   - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Use Slash Commands`
7. Copy the generated URL and open it to invite the bot to your server

### 2. Get your IDs

- **Client ID**: Found on the **OAuth2** page of your app
- **Guild ID**: Right-click your Discord server → Copy Server ID  
  *(Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings first: User Settings → Advanced)*

### 3. Install & configure

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the env template
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here
```

### 4. Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

You should see: `✅ Logged in as YourBot#1234` followed by `✅ Slash commands registered`.

The bot registers its slash commands with Discord automatically on every startup — no separate step needed. `npm run deploy` still exists if you ever want to register commands without starting the whole bot (e.g. from a machine that isn't running it).
